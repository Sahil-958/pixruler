# PixRuler

TLDR;A simple ruler for measuring pixels on your screen. It's a simple tool that allows you to measure the size of elements on your screen.

A python script that take screenshot of current screen and shows 4 lines originating from the cursor to nearast edge detected on the image. The length of the lines are shown in pixels. It lets you customize the canny params which are used to define which is considered as an edge and which is not. It also lets you customize the color of the lines, thickness, text size and offset and some more useful features.

The README going to be updated soon when a i turn the MVP into a full fledged tool.
